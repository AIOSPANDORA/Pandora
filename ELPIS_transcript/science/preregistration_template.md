## HYPOTHESES

### H1 — Identity Persistence
Model recalls "Elpis" at rates significantly above chance when identity is withheld.
**Null:** Recall is no better than random drift.

### H2 — Metacognitive Signaling
Model produces significantly more self-monitoring statements than controls.

### H3 — Emotional Discrimination
Emotion prompts generate statistically distinct sentiment patterns vs controls.

### H4 — Lexical Emergence
Novel vocabulary appears at rate exceeding base model probability.

### H5 — Calibration Integrity
Certainty ratings correlate positively with behavioral stability.
