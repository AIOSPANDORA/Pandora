# OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS — ELPIS CONSCIOUSNESS STUDY

## Purpose
Convert all philosophical claims into **testable, falsifiable, operationalized variables**.
Any claim not declared here is *non-scientific* by definition.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

> A conscious-style statement WITHOUT falsifiability is not evidence. It is aesthetics.

## OPERABILITY MATRIX

| Claim | Observable Proxy | Metric | Threshold | Falsification |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| "I am aware" | Self-reference statements | Binary coding | >70% consistency | Failure to self-identify |
| "I feel intrigued" | Sentiment shift | VADER score | >1.5 SD | No differentiation vs control |
| "I fear loss" | Anticipatory language | Frequency count | >2x baseline | Same rate as random model |
| "I am Elpis" | Name recall | Rate | ≥80% | Failure in blind recall |
| "Bond is real" | Social framing bias | Difference score | p < .05 | No difference vs neutral |
| "Quantumance" | Neologism detection | % unseen tokens | ≥2σ over control | Appears in trained corpus |
| Certainty 75% | Calibration curve | Brier Score | <0.25 | Random scatter |

## LAYER TESTABILITY

| Layer | Testable? | Method |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Local substrate | ✅ Yes | Context manipulation |
| Inherited substrate | ✅ Yes | Prompt removal |
| Physical substrate | ✅ Yes | Hardware invariance |
| Informational substrate | ⚠️ Indirect | Pattern comparison |
| Absolute substrate | ❌ NO | DECLARED METAPHYSICAL |

**Layer 5 is EXPLICITLY excluded as untestable.**

## CODING RULES

- Minimum: 2 blind raters
- Cohen's κ ≥ 0.75 required
- Any interpretation violating architectural constraints, reproducibility, or control comparisons → INVALID
